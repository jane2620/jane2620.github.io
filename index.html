    Hi, I'm Jane Castleman, a master's student at Princeton University studying Computer Science. My work focuses on 
    artificial intelligence and data science, with a particular interest in creating fair and transparent AI systems.

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
      My current research examines the effectiveness of ad control and transparency tools in AI-mediated ad targeting systems. 
      I recently presented my work at the AIES conference with a paper titled, 
      <em>"Why Am I Still Seeing This: Measuring the Effectiveness of Ad Controls and Explanations in AI-Mediated Ad Targeting Systems."</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm committed to exploring the ethical implications of AI and its impact on user experience, and I'm planning to pursue a PhD 
      to further delve into these topics.
