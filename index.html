        I'm a second-year Master's student in Computer Science at Princeton University advised by <a href="https://www.korolova.com/" target="_blank">Aleksandra Korolova</a>, working in the <a href="https://citp.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Center for Information Technology Policy</a>.

        My research centers around the reliability, fairness, and privacy of AI systems. 
        My goal is to evaluate their social impacts and improve their trustworthiness, drawing upon methods from measurement science, statistics, and machine learning. 
        I hope my work can inform both technical and policy decisions. My work has been published in venues such as ACM FAccT and AIES.

        I recently started a blog, <a href="https://eclecticai.substack.com/">Eclectic Notes on AI</a> with Aleksandra Korolova. Check it out!

      <h3>Misc</h3>
      <p>Outside of graduate school, I enjoy spending time outside and playing sports. I was a member of the inaugural <a href="https://goprincetontigers.com/sports/wrugby">Varsity Women's Rugby team</a> at Princeton and was selected to the National Intercollegiate Rugby All-Academic team in 2023.</p>
      <p>I'm always happy to discuss research ideas or talk to students thinking about applying to graduate school.</p>
